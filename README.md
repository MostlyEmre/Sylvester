## Description

A Chrome extension that hides anxiety driving Twitter features. These changes are needed for my mental wellbeing. If you think that the changes are unnecessary. Feel free to not use the extension.

## How to Install

## Features

😾 Sylvester helps you hide the following Twitter features:

- Hide "Trending" Window
- Hide "Like" Count
- Hide "Explore" Menu Button
- Hide "Who to Follow" Window
- Hide the Number of Followers

## TODO

Feel free to contribute, open issues, etc.

- [ ] Hide Fact-Checks, Dispute Warnings, etc.
- [ ] Provide the extension features as options.
- [ ] Hide "Topics to Follow"
- [ ] Hide Social Context Features (i.e "Britney Spears retweeted", "No Doubt liked", "Backstreet Boys, Savage Garden and more follow") (I can implement this right now but read the next TODO to learn more.)
- [ ] Find a way to hide social context with CSS. (I don't want to hide retweets necessarily. With JS level styling I can style whichever element I want, however this is not ideal, I would love to hide the elements with CSS (!important). Because CSS hides elements quickly and automatically without any heavyduty actions.)
